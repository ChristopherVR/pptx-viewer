# Shared UI migration evidence

The migration uses shared logic, open-shadow views and CSS from
`pptx-viewer-shared`. Native adapters retain document mutations, history,
persistence and framework lifecycle. The contributor's 126 work units are an
inventory of surfaces, not 126 required public custom-element tags.

## Theme editor (#364)

The baseline was recorded on the issue before implementation. All screenshots
use the same sample deck, 1440 x 900 viewport and Design > Edit Theme entry.

| Binding | Baseline placement          | Before                                                         | Shared editor                                                |
| ------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| React   | Right dock below the ribbon | [Before](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/react-before.png)   | [After](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/react-after.png)   |
| Vue     | Full-window fixed overlay   | [Before](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/vue-before.png)     | [After](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/vue-after.png)     |

| Svelte  | Editor inside the ribbon    | [Before](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/svelte-before.png)  | [After](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/svelte-after.png)  |
| Vanilla | Right dock below the ribbon | [Before](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/vanilla-before.png) | [After](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/vanilla-after.png) |

The shared editor docks against the editor body, with a bottom sheet below
768px. Every binding offers the same ten presets, twelve colors, font fields,
preview, Apply, Reset and Close. Fields and presets update a local draft;
Apply sends one complete detached edit to the native host. Reset restores the
current host theme. Close and Escape discard the draft and restore opener
focus. Secondary inline placements use the same view without automatic focus.

The property/event/lifecycle contract is documented in
`packages/shared/src/web-components/README.md`. The neutral browser spec is
`e2e/theme-editor-migration.spec.ts`; it checks docking, focus, draft dismissal,
Reset, Apply, saved theme XML, narrow actions and forced colors. Adapter unit
tests cover native callbacks, disabled state and React 18/19 compatibility.

## Incremental ribbon rollout (#363)

The integrated Slide Show, Help and Record batches establish the command/group
contract and five-binding adapters. Future tab batches must record comparable
baselines before implementation, preserve public customization ids, replace
duplicate view/CSS and verify their own native actions. Generic buttons should
be extracted only when their contract differs from a ribbon command. The
milestone and focused tab issues carry the remaining inventory; slide-content
rendering remains a separate architecture decision.

The completed foundation issues are #346 (search), #347 (File spacing), #348
(checkboxes) and #349 (app-owned selects). Slide Show (#360/#361), the lifecycle
contract (#362), Help (#366), Record (#367) and Subtitle Settings (#365) are
integrated. Theme-editor parity is delivered in #364. These completion records
do not claim that the remaining UI inventory has already migrated.

| Distinct non-ribbon buttons and icon-buttons | #386  | ChristopherVR |

These are native children of #363 in the Thin UI adapters milestone. Each has
its own baseline, shared/native boundary and validation requirements. Their
`ui:planned` status means implementation is still outstanding; contributors
should claim a bounded family before starting to avoid overlapping changes.

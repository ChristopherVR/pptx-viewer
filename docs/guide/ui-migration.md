# Shared UI migration evidence

The migration uses shared logic, open-shadow views and CSS from
`pptx-viewer-shared`. Native adapters retain document mutations, history,
persistence and framework lifecycle. The contributor's 126 work units are an
inventory of surfaces, not 126 required public custom-element tags.

## Theme editor (#364)

The baseline was recorded on the issue before implementation. All screenshots
use the same sample deck, 1440 x 900 viewport and Design > Edit Theme entry.

| Binding | Baseline placement          | Before                                                         | Shared editor                                                |
| ------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| React   | Right dock below the ribbon | [Before](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/react-before.png)   | [After](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/react-after.png)   |
| Vue     | Full-window fixed overlay   | [Before](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/vue-before.png)     | [After](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/vue-after.png)     |
| Angular | Centered gallery modal      | [Before](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/angular-before.png) | [After](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/angular-after.png) |
| Svelte  | Editor inside the ribbon    | [Before](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/svelte-before.png)  | [After](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/svelte-after.png)  |
| Vanilla | Right dock below the ribbon | [Before](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/vanilla-before.png) | [After](/assets/ui-migration/theme-editor/vanilla-after.png) |

The shared editor docks against the editor body, with a bottom sheet below
768px. Every binding offers the same ten presets, twelve colors, font fields,
preview, Apply, Reset and Close. Fields and presets update a local draft;
Apply sends one complete detached edit to the native host. Reset restores the
current host theme. Close and Escape discard the draft and restore opener
focus. Secondary inline placements use the same view without automatic focus.

The property/event/lifecycle contract is documented in
`packages/shared/src/web-components/README.md`. The neutral browser spec is
`e2e/theme-editor-migration.spec.ts`; it checks docking, focus, draft dismissal,
Reset, Apply, saved theme XML, narrow actions and forced colors. Adapter unit
tests cover native callbacks, disabled state and React 18/19 compatibility.

## Incremental ribbon rollout (#363)

The integrated Slide Show, Help and Record batches establish the command/group
contract and five-binding adapters. Future tab batches must record comparable
baselines before implementation, preserve public customization ids, replace
duplicate view/CSS and verify their own native actions. Generic buttons should
be extracted only when their contract differs from a ribbon command. The
milestone and focused tab issues carry the remaining inventory; slide-content
rendering remains a separate architecture decision.

The completed foundation issues are #346 (search), #347 (File spacing), #348
(checkboxes) and #349 (app-owned selects). Slide Show (#360/#361), the lifecycle
contract (#362), Help (#366), Record (#367) and Subtitle Settings (#365) are
integrated. Theme-editor parity is delivered in #364. These completion records
do not claim that the remaining UI inventory has already migrated.

| Planned family                               | Issue | Owner         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------- |
| Remaining Home controls                      | #373  | ChristopherVR |
| Insert                                       | #374  | ChristopherVR |
| Transitions                                  | #377  | ChristopherVR |
| Animations                                   | #378  | ChristopherVR |
| View                                         | #380  | ChristopherVR |
| Distinct non-ribbon buttons and icon-buttons | #386  | ChristopherVR |

These are native children of #363 in the Thin UI adapters milestone. Each has
its own baseline, shared/native boundary and validation requirements. Their
`ui:planned` status means implementation is still outstanding; contributors
should claim a bounded family before starting to avoid overlapping changes.

## Design, Review and contextual galleries

Design (#376), Review (#379), Shape Format (#381), Picture Format (#382),
Table Design (#383), Chart Design (#384) and SmartArt Design (#385) now use
shared groups, commands and gallery views in all five bindings. The main UI
rework tracker (#342) remains open for the remaining families above.

Design command metadata controls availability and open state. Review uses
seven canonical groups and a keyed section view that preserves command focus
when native state changes. Gallery descriptors supply previews and selection;
the shared view owns popup placement, keyboard navigation, dismissal, touch
targets and forced-color styling. Native hosts still own document edits,
history, selection, comments, dialogs and saving. The property/event contract
is in `packages/shared/src/web-components/README.md`.

Comparable screenshots use the same decks and 1440 x 900 viewport. Baseline
files are in `/assets/ui-migration/ribbon-baseline/`; completed views are in
`/assets/ui-migration/ribbon-after/`. Filenames combine the binding and tab,
for example `react-review.png` and `vue-shapeFormat.png`.

Neutral browser coverage is in `ribbon-contextual-migration.spec.ts`,
`ribbon-gallery-migration.spec.ts` and `ribbon-review-migration.spec.ts`.
It exercises actual chart and SmartArt style/color edits through save and
reload, Review spelling/language/comments actions, customization, focus,
narrow layouts, touch targets and forced colors. Save/reload checks also
identified and fixed missing SmartArt quick-style intensity serialization,
SmartArt color-definition updates and chart gallery selection reconstruction.

## Draw

Draw (#375) uses one controlled shared view for Select, Pen, Highlighter,
Eraser, Freeform, color and width. Native hosts own pointer gestures, ink
creation, erasure, history and recent-color persistence. Live custom-color
input updates the tool; a committed choice also updates native recent colors.
All five bindings offer the same width range (1 to 16) and presets.

The view preserves public customization ids and focused tool buttons during
state updates. The color palette clamps to the viewport, closes on outside
pointer or Escape, and restores opener focus on Escape. Read-only hosts
disable drawing intents. Theme tokens, forced colors and coarse-pointer
targets follow the shared control contract. Comparable screenshots are
`<binding>-draw.png` in the baseline and after directories.

`e2e/ribbon-draw-migration.spec.ts` covers keyboard tool activation, native
ink creation, undo/redo, InkML save/reload, customization, tokens, touch
targets and dismissal. Saved InkML verifies width and color; rendered paths
or pressure circles verify the reloaded stroke. Existing highlighter and
tilt specs separately cover variable geometry.
